The Wyckoff style is to trade only the best stocks in the leading sectors. Can you use this motto when trading cryptocurrencies? It is an emerging asset class but figuring out which cryptocurrency has actual **value** will make your decisions a lot clearer:

* You want to buy/hold a *valuable* asset through shorter timespans when the *price* is not reflecting the value (yet).
* You want to take profits and abandon an asset that is appreciating in the short term because of things like tiny market hence manipulation, or media hype.

#### How strong a coin is

> The Wyckoffian mission is to trade and invest in the best stocks in the leading Industry Groups. We have been studying examples of leadership characteristics using **Wyckoff Analysis** in combination with **Relative Strength**. [...] Always seeking the strongest stocks in the strongest groups. It is also a worthwhile exercise to study groups that are stalling and falling from favor. [StockCharts](http://stockcharts.com/articles/wyckoff/2017/02/avoidance-strategy.html)

The key point is that a leader of a group dies not remain a leader indefinitely. At some point the leader leaves the limelight, becomes a laggard and may stay a laggard for some time. That's what the Wyckoff avoidance strategy is about - spotting the transition from leader to laggard and avoiding longing that market rather than getting to think in forever terms.  

This transition is a substantial change, technically you should be looking for it on longer timeframes (daily, 3D or weekly charts).

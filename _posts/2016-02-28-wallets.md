You must be reading this all the time, but still: Never keep untrader coins on an exchange and never send coins from one exchange to another.

####Hardware Altcoin Wallets

If you want to hold an altcoin that you think should grow in the future, you should get either wallet as a software or a hardware wallet.

  * {% aff Ledger Wallet https://www.ledgerwallet.com/r/e274 %} said they will not support any altcoins.
  * {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} on the other hand supports Electrum wallet which also has Dash and Litecoin integration. There is a full {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} integration now so you can hold bitcoins, litecoins and dash on a single {% aff Trezor https://buytrezor.com?a=fany@tutanota.com %} device.

####Electrum for Litecoin

Get it {% aff here https://electrum-ltc.org/ %} (official website). It is a regular Electrum wallet, still with the privacy flaw of being able to tell which pool of addresses belong to a single wallet.

####Electrum for Dash

Another Electrum flavor is Dash wallet. You can get it from {% aff Dash homepage https://www.dash.org/downloads %}.

####Web Based Altcoin Wallets

For altcoin trading you will be best off with a multi-currency wallet. Go for {% aff Cryptonator https://www.cryptonator.com/about %}. It can hold litecoins, dash, bitcoin and other coins. You will also be able to generate addresses as you go.
